# PicShare End-to-End Encryption Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for PicShare, ensuring that only intended recipients can view media content. The solution draws from industry best practices, particularly Signal's proven architecture, while adapting to PicShare's social media use case.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **Zero Knowledge**: Server never sees unencrypted content or keys
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption/decryption happens on user devices
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Per-post encryption keys with recipient-specific access
- **Password-Based Recovery**: Secure key backup tied to user credentials

### High-Level Architecture
```
[User Device] ←E2EE→ [PicShare Server] ←E2EE→ [Recipient Device]
    │                  │
    ├─ Generate keys   ├─ Store encrypted keys
    ├─ Encrypt media   ├─ Manage access control
    ├─ Decrypt media   └─ Distribute encrypted keys
    └─ Key management
```

## 2. Cryptographic Foundation

### Encryption Standards
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (for media files)
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: X25519 + Ed25519 (from Signal Protocol)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id (for password-based key protection)
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for integrity checks

### Key Hierarchy
```
User Password
    ↓ (Argon2id)
Derived Key
    ↓ (AES-256-GCM)
Encrypted Private Key
    ↓ (Decrypt with password)
User Private Key (Ed25519)
    ↓ (Sign)
Media Encryption Key (AES-256)
    ↓ (Encrypt media)
Encrypted Media File
```

## 3. Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
```sql
-- User key management
CREATE TABLE user_crypto_keys (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    public_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- Base64 encoded Ed25519 public key
    encrypted_private_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- AES-256-GCM encrypted private key
    key_derivation_salt TEXT NOT NULL, -- Base64 encoded salt
    key_derivation_iterations INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 100000,
    key_derivation_algorithm TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Argon2id',
    key_created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    key_last_rotated TIMESTAMPTZ,
    recovery_key_hash TEXT -- Hash of recovery code for key recovery
);

-- Media encryption keys (one per media file)
CREATE TABLE media_encryption_keys (
    media_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES media(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    encryption_key_encrypted TEXT NOT NULL, -- Encrypted with owner's public key
    encryption_algorithm TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'AES-256-GCM',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Recipient access keys
CREATE TABLE media_recipient_keys (
    media_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES media(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    recipient_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    encrypted_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- Media key encrypted with recipient's public key
    added_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (media_id, recipient_id)
);

-- Key rotation history (for auditing)
CREATE TABLE key_rotation_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    old_key_fingerprint TEXT,
    new_key_fingerprint TEXT,
    rotated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    reason TEXT
);
```

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Cryptographic Foundation (2-3 weeks)
**Objective**: Set up core cryptographic utilities and key management

**Tasks**:
1. **Add cryptographic dependencies**:
   ```toml
   # Cargo.toml additions
   [dependencies]
   ring = "0.16" # For cryptographic primitives
   argon2 = "0.5" # For password-based key derivation
   ed25519-dalek = "2.0" # For Signal-compatible keys
   aes-gcm = "0.10" # For AES-GCM encryption
   base64 = "0.21" # For key serialization
   ```

2. **Implement cryptographic utilities** (`src/infra/crypto.rs`):
   - Key generation (Ed25519/X25519)
   - Password-based key derivation (Argon2id)
   - AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
   - Key serialization/deserialization

3. **Add user key management endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/v1/crypto/keys` - Generate new key pair
   - `GET /api/v1/crypto/keys` - Get public key and encrypted private key
   - `POST /api/v1/crypto/keys/rotate` - Rotate keys

4. **Implement password-based key backup**:
   - Client-side key encryption before storage
   - Server-side storage of encrypted keys
   - Key decryption on login

### Phase 2: Media Encryption (3-4 weeks)
**Objective**: Enable encrypted media uploads and storage

**Tasks**:
1. **Modify upload flow**:
   - Client generates random AES-256 key for each media file
   - Client encrypts media file before upload
   - Client encrypts AES key with their public key
   - Server stores encrypted media + encrypted key

2. **Update media service** (`src/app/media.rs`):
   ```rust
   pub struct EncryptedMediaUpload {
       pub upload_id: Uuid,
       pub object_key: String,
       pub upload_url: String,
       pub encryption_info: EncryptionInfo, // New field
   }

   pub struct EncryptionInfo {
       pub algorithm: String,
       pub key_encrypted: String, // Encrypted with user's public key
       pub iv: String, // Initialization vector
       pub auth_tag: String, // Authentication tag
   }
   ```

3. **Add media encryption endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/v1/media/encrypted` - Upload encrypted media metadata
   - `GET /api/v1/media/{id}/keys` - Get encryption keys for authorized users

4. **Implement key distribution**:
   - When post is created, encrypt media key for each eligible recipient
   - Store recipient keys in `media_recipient_keys` table

### Phase 3: Access Control & Sharing (2-3 weeks)
**Objective**: Implement fine-grained access control for encrypted media

**Tasks**:
1. **Modify post visibility logic**:
   - When post visibility changes, update recipient keys
   - Add/remove recipient keys as follow relationships change

2. **Implement key distribution service**:
   ```rust
   pub struct KeyDistributionService {
       db: Db,
       crypto: CryptoService,
   }

   impl KeyDistributionService {
       pub async fn share_media_with_followers(
           &self,
           media_id: Uuid,
           owner_id: Uuid,
       ) -> Result<()> {
           // Get all followers of owner
           // Encrypt media key with each follower's public key
           // Store in media_recipient_keys
       }

       pub async fn get_decryption_keys(
           &self,
           user_id: Uuid,
           media_id: Uuid,
       ) -> Result<Option<DecryptionKeys>> {
           // Check if user has access to media
           // Return encrypted key if authorized
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Update feed service** to include encryption keys:
   - Modify `get_home_feed` to return encryption keys for accessible media
   - Add client-side decryption capabilities

### Phase 4: Client Implementation (4-6 weeks, parallel)
**Objective**: Build frontend/client-side encryption capabilities

**Tasks**:
1. **Web Client (JavaScript/TypeScript)**:
   - Use Web Crypto API for browser-based encryption
   - Implement key management with IndexedDB storage
   - Add media encryption before upload
   - Implement media decryption after download

2. **Mobile Clients (Future)**:
   - Native encryption libraries for iOS/Android
   - Secure enclave storage for private keys
   - Background encryption for large files

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Progressive enhancement for browsers without Web Crypto
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported devices

## 5. Signal Protocol Integration

### Components to Adopt from Signal

1. **Double Ratchet Algorithm**:
   - Provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security
   - Automatic key rotation for ongoing conversations

2. **X3DH Key Agreement**:
   - Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman for initial key exchange
   - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks

3. **Session Management**:
   - Signal's session building and management
   - Handling of lost or compromised keys

### Implementation Approach

```rust
// src/infra/signal_protocol.rs
pub struct SignalProtocol {
    identity_key: IdentityKey,
    signed_pre_key: SignedPreKey,
    pre_keys: Vec<PreKey>,
    sessions: HashMap<Uuid, SessionState>,
}

impl SignalProtocol {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // Initialize with fresh key material
    }

    pub fn establish_session(&mut self, recipient_public_key: &PublicKey) -> SessionResult {
        // Implement X3DH key agreement
    }

    pub fn encrypt_message(&self, session_id: Uuid, plaintext: &[u8]) -> EncryptedMessage {
        // Implement Double Ratchet encryption
    }

    pub fn decrypt_message(&mut self, session_id: Uuid, ciphertext: &EncryptedMessage) -> DecryptionResult {
        // Implement Double Ratchet decryption
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Signal Protocol
- **Proven Security**: Used by billions of users
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromised keys don't reveal past messages
- **Post-Compromise Security**: Key rotation limits damage from key theft
- **Interoperability**: Potential future compatibility with other Signal-based apps

## 6. Security Considerations

   - New posts can be encrypted
   - Educate users about benefits

2. **Phase 2: Default Encryption (1 month)**:
   - New accounts get encryption by default
   - Existing users prompted to enable
   - Provide migration tools

3. **Phase 3: Full Encryption (3 months)**:
   - All new media encrypted
   - Legacy media gradually re-encrypted
   - Final cutoff for unencrypted content

### Backward Compatibility
- Support both encrypted and unencrypted media during transition
- Clear indicators for encryption status
